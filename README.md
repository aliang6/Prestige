# Prestige
Analyze articles for emotion and bias, understand important concepts, and be provided with a succinct summary.

## Audience
Readers who want to be more informed about the legitimacy of an article or who may be unfamiliar with the subject matter. Also useful for writers checking for article bias.

## Experience
The user enters the webpage, and sees the option to enter a website url that links to an article. They then press a button to analyze their inputs and are returned with understandable and visually appealing results. Additional features to have the article read out loud and also the option to have it translated will be implemented later.
